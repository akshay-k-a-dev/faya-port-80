# Minutes of the Meeting - April 26

Members Present:   [@deepusnath][deepu], [@rejahrehim][rejah],  Sujith Unni(Nasscom)

## Discussions & Decisions

###1. Speaker Confirmation:  
Discussion with four speakers are in progress and one speaker almost confirmed. If we could get them, we don't have to look for more external speakers. We have around 7 speaker slots and we also need to finalize the 6 Panelists for Panel Discussion and send them invitations. 

#### Panel discussion and Facilitation:  
Panel Discussion and Facilitation function should be kept by evening as the delay for special guests should not delay the program. 

###2. Draft Programe Agenda and Topics of Discussion : 
Once we get better clarity on the speaker list, we can finalise the Agenda and make sure the topics of different speakers are complimentary. 

###3. Microsite: 
FAYA will create a page for the event with details which can be used to send out Sponsorship emails. Nasscom will use that page to list in their event list.

###4. Sponsorship Emails : 
We need to send out sponsorship emails early next week. We roughly expect around 10 lakhs as sponsorship. 

###5 Budget : 
We came with a rough estimate for event budget as 10 Lakhs. SUjith with check with their event vendor and confirm the rates of some elements in the list. Once we get that, we will also look for more options for better pricing. A rough calculation came around Rs. 8,40,000

 Nasscom will check with internet providers to see if there are any possibilities of sponsorship of internet for the event.
